# working with remotes
### adding a remote
Allows you to use to push and fetch/pull from a foreign repository.
* git link = copy this from a github or bitbucket repo (on the right side)
* remote-name = This is a _place name_.  Usually `origin` or `upstream`.
```sh
git remote add [remote-name] [git link]
git remote add upstream git@github.com:tgaff/git_intro.git
```

### pushing to a remote
Takes the commits on your branch and puts them on the remote.
* remote-name = This is a _place name_.  Usually `origin` or `upstream`.
* branch-name = at first `master` later we'll have others
```sh
git push [remote-name] [branch-name]
git push origin master # push branch master to origin
```

### cloning a remote repository
Gets a remote repo and stores its commits in a subdirectory of your current directory.
* git link = copy this from a github repo (on the right side)
```sh
git clone [git link]
git clone git@github.com:tgaff/git_intro.git
```

### setup a new repository (empty, without cloning)
Turns the current directory into a new git repo.
```sh
git init
```

# working with branches


### git checkout

* branch-name = at first `master` later we'll have others
```sh
git checkout [branch-name]
git checkout master
git checkout fix_spacing_bug
```


### git checkout -b 
Creates a new branch and switches to it
* branch-name = at first `master` later we'll have others
```sh
git checkout -b [branch-name]
git checkout -b new_feature
```


### git branch  
Shows your local branches and which one you're on.
```sh
git branch
git branch -r # show remote branches
```


### git branch [branch-name]  
Creates a new branch.
* branch-name = a name for the new branch
```sh
git branch [branch-name]
git branch my_new_feature
```
Usually followed by a `git checkout [branch-name]`.  See also `git checkout -b`.
